Introduction

In my last 5 years I earned ennough money to open a Coffee Shop in Toronto. So I want to know where is the best location!


Business Problem

I know that there are a lot of other coffee shops in Toronto. The best way to have more revenues is to find a place
where my competition is low.
The goal is to have the highest profit avoiding direct competition with other places.
