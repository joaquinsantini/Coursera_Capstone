Data Section

I will use information about the city of Toronto from Wikipedia, OpenStreetMaps and Foursquare.

Wikipedia source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

OpenStreetMaps source: API in Python using the GeoPy library

Foursquare source: API in Python

The first step is to load the information from Wikipedia to obtain the neighbourhoods from Toronto. Then, the second step
is to locate with latitude and longitude every neighbourhood of Toronto. The next step is to use the Foursquare API to
know the location of other coffee shops in every neighbourhood to know where I can open my own coffee shop.
